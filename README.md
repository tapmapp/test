Whola Proyect (Angular, NodeJS, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, Google Charts)
============

Whola it's an affiliation system and a bridge between brands, consumers and providers.  The goal of this proyect is to give the opportunity to small merchants to create advertising campaigns highly effective and low cost. Capture data from the clients purchases, allows me to know what products they like and when they buy them. I also want to sell data to the brands behind the products the clients buy. I think it has thousands of nice marketing applications and i the future people is going to register all the products they buy.

It has a web plataform where traders can see the evolution of their business. Make lists of potential consumers depending of what kind of product they want to promote, and send advertising to them in a cheap and easy way.
